// ("EXTEND the family"). Same doctrine as core.ts's roster-derived
// TOTAL_TOOLS: names derive from PACK_OF, never from hand lists that
// silently drift. The case assembly itself is the shared cases/index.ts
// module the runner imports, so this guard can never lag the suite; the
// count assertion pins the total against the docs/workflow numbers
// (33) so count drift fails loudly instead of silently re-budgeting the
