// Service region descriptor, migrated verbatim from the inline `known` table
// in tools.ts getRegionalAvailability. TS-as-data, same as PACK_IDS/PACK_OF.
//
// Guarantee scope, stated honestly:
//   - the `satisfies` check pins only the VALUE shape (every entry is a
//     readonly string array); Record<string, ...> has open keys, so a missing
//     or extra service still compiles;
//   - KEY-set completeness is pinned by test/service-regions.test.ts, which
//     hardcodes the 17-service list and fails when the table drifts (unlike
//     PACK_OF there is no closed key union to lean on — do not borrow that
//     pattern here);
//   - what the compiler does catch is a use-site typo: SERVICE_REGIONS.ecs is
//     a property access on this object, so a misspelled key fails the build.
//
// regions is the only field: it is the one service-metadata consumer that
// exists today (getRegionalAvailability). operations, risk hints, and icons
// stay in their current homes until a consumer exists.
