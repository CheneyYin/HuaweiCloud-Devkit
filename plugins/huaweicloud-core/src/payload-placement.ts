// through the MCP tools (list_packs / pack_info / list_skills /

// tree's location (skillRoot) at initialize, and list_skills carries it too
// for direct reads; the core
// meta-skills are ADDITIONALLY disclosed natively by syncNativeCoreSkills,
// so every install and update path must place the tree next to the server
// it deploys (the native sync rides the same PAYLOAD_TARGETS table from
// the dispatch layer).
